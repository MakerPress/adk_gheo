This is a blank repository for Maker Press.  You (or the editor, or administrator, or whoever) must have a public key installed in /home/project/.ssh/authorized_keys2 file.  How we'll administer this in the long term is a bit of a mystery right now that we need to solve.

Here's what you (or your editor) need to do to install it:

* Create a working copy on your local machine
** Clone a fresh project repo from the MakerPress account to your local machine.  The command is:
*** git clone git@github.com:MakerPress/freshProject.git
** Modify the _project.ini_ file (project name, author, etc)
** Commit your changes to the local copy.  The command is:
*** git commit -a -m"Initial working Repo"
*  Create a repository on Github for your new project 
** Create a new repository in your personal GitHub account.  For example, "my_new_project.git"
** Add a remote in your local copy to your new project on GitHub:
***  git remote add origin git@github.com:odewahn/my_new_project.git
** Push your changes to your new working project repository on GitHub
*** git push origin master
* Push the project to the authoring environment
** Add a remote to the repo for your authoring environment
*** git remote add project project@<your server address>:git_incoming
** Push the repo to your project server:
*** git push project master
** Copy the incoming repository to the working repository:
*** ssh project@<your server address> "./move_incoming_to_working.sh"
** Write and edit your project on the server using the wiki
** Retrieve your local
